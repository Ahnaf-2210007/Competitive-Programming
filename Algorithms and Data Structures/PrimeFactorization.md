### Explanation of My Code
My code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes to precompute prime numbers up to `MAX` and stores them in the vector `primes`. Then, it uses this precomputed list of primes for efficiently performing prime factorization on a given number `n`. Let's break down the code step by step.

---

#### 1. **Global Variables**
```cpp
const int MAX = 1000000;
vector<int> primes;
```
- `MAX` is set to 1,000,000, which defines the upper limit for the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
- `primes` is a vector to store all prime numbers up to `MAX`.

---

#### 2. **Sieve of Eratosthenes**
```cpp
void sieve() {
    vector<bool> isPrime(MAX + 1, true);
    isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = false; // 0 and 1 are not prime numbers
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= MAX; i++) {
        if (isPrime[i]) {
            for (int j = i * i; j <= MAX; j += i)
                isPrime[j] = false; // Mark multiples of i as non-prime
        }
    }
    for (int i = 2; i <= MAX; i++) {
        if (isPrime[i])
            primes.push_back(i); // Store primes in the vector
    }
}
```
- **Initialization**: Creates a boolean array `isPrime` to mark whether numbers are prime.
- **Outer Loop**: Iterates through potential primes `i`.
- **Inner Loop**: Marks multiples of `i` as non-prime.
- **Storing Primes**: After the sieve completes, all numbers marked as `true` are stored in the `primes` vector.

---

#### 3. **Prime Factorization**
```cpp
ll primeFactorization(ll n) {
    ll cnt = 0;
    for (int prime : primes) {
        if (prime * prime > n) break; // If prime > sqrt(n), stop
        while (n % prime == 0) {
            cnt++;  // Count the occurrence of the prime factor
            n /= prime;
        }
    }
    if (n > 1) cnt++; // If n is a prime number greater than sqrt(n)
    return cnt;
}
```
- **Iterates Over Primes**: Uses the precomputed `primes` list to check divisibility.
- **Counting Factors**: For each prime factor, counts its occurrences and divides `n` by that prime.
- **Handling Large Primes**: If `n` is still greater than 1 after the loop, it means `n` itself is a prime number, so it's counted as a factor.

### Alternative Approaches to `cnt++` Logic
The `cnt++` part in your code is used to count prime factors. Depending on the specific problem you are solving, you might want to adjust this logic. Here are some variations:

1. **Counting Distinct Prime Factors**
   ```cpp
   if (n > 1) cnt += 1; // Counts only once for a prime factor > sqrt(n)
   ```
   - Use this if you only need the count of **distinct** prime factors.

2. **Sum of Exponents of Prime Factors**
   ```cpp
   if (n > 1) cnt += log2(n); // Count based on the exponent of the prime factor
   ```
   - Use this if you need the **sum of the exponents** of all prime factors.

3. **Prime Factorization with Multiplicities**
   - If you need to store the actual prime factors along with their counts:
     ```cpp
     map<int, int> factorCount;
     for (int prime : primes) {
         if (prime * prime > n) break;
         while (n % prime == 0) {
             factorCount[prime]++;
             n /= prime;
         }
     }
     if (n > 1) factorCount[n]++;
     ```
   - This approach is useful when you need to store **factors with their frequencies**.

4. **Finding the Largest Prime Factor**
   ```cpp
   int largestPrime = -1;
   for (int prime : primes) {
       if (prime * prime > n) break;
       while (n % prime == 0) {
           largestPrime = prime;
           n /= prime;
       }
   }
   if (n > 1) largestPrime = n; // n itself is prime
   ```
   - Use this if you want to find the **largest prime factor** of `n`.

### Full Organized Code

Here's how you can organize your code for better readability and maintainability before uploading it to GitHub:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

#define ll long long

const int MAX = 1000000;
vector<int> primes;

// Function to perform the Sieve of Eratosthenes
void sieve() {
    vector<bool> isPrime(MAX + 1, true);
    isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = false;
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= MAX; i++) {
        if (isPrime[i]) {
            for (int j = i * i; j <= MAX; j += i)
                isPrime[j] = false;
        }
    }
    for (int i = 2; i <= MAX; i++) {
        if (isPrime[i])
            primes.push_back(i);
    }
}

// Function to count total prime factors of n
ll countPrimeFactors(ll n) {
    ll cnt = 0;
    for (int prime : primes) {
        if (prime * prime > n) break;
        while (n % prime == 0) {
            cnt++;
            n /= prime;
        }
    }
    if (n > 1) cnt++;
    return cnt;
}

// Main Function to Test
int main() {
    sieve(); // Precompute primes
    ll n;
    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> n;
    cout << "Total Prime Factors: " << countPrimeFactors(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
