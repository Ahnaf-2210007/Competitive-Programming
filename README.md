# Competitive-Programmin Repository

**Welcome to my competitive programming repository! Here, I will be adding:**

- Solutions to various coding problems from different platforms (e.g., `Codeforces`, `Codechef`, `HackerRank` etc.).
- Solutions from varius cp sheet like `Cses`, `TLE Eliminators` etc.
- Custom macros and utility functions to simplify repetitive tasks in competitive programming.
- Essential `algorithms` and `data structures` implemented for quick reference.

This repo will serve as my personal collection of solved problems, reusable code snippets, and templates, all aimed to enhance my problem-solving efficiency.
